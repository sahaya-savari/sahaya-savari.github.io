      <p>
        Machine learning is a way of teaching computers to learn from data instead of
        programming every rule manually.
      </p>

      <p>
        In simple terms, we show examples to the computer, and it finds patterns on its own.
        These patterns help it make predictions or decisions later.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need heavy math to get started. What matters first is understanding the idea:
        data → patterns → predictions.
      </p>

        This post is part of my personal learning journey in AI and Python.
