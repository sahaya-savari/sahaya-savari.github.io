        Machine learning is a way of teaching computers to learn from data
        instead of programming every rule manually.
      </p>

      <p>
        In simple terms, we give examples to a computer, and it tries to
        identify patterns on its own. Over time, these patterns help the
        system make predictions or decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first started learning machine learning, I thought it was
        all about complex mathematics. But what actually matters first is
        understanding the idea behind it.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        data → patterns → predictions
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Once this flow is clear, the technical details become much easier
        to understand. This post reflects my current understanding as a
        learner, not as an expert.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am documenting my learning journey so that I can revise concepts
        later and also help beginners who are starting from scratch.
